# GEOL503FinalProject
Final Project for GEOL 503 Spring 2024

This repository contains the final project for Spring 2024 GEOL 503. It focuses on creating seepage velocity maps based on a few point location data from my MS thesis work. The point locations are based on mini piezometer and Streambed Point Velocity Probe (SBPVP) placement and are located in Alder Creek, a small tributary stream located in Ontario, Canada.

There are two different R files - one for Site 1 (a meander of Alder Creek) and another for Site 2 (a straight away for Alder Creek). These R files have 5 .csv files associated with them which can be found in the 'DataFiles' folder. 

The data files for Site 1 are:
James_Site1_MiniPiez_Coord.csv (coordinates in Lat/Long for the mini piezometers)
James_Site1_SBPVP_Coord.csv (coordinates in Lat/Long for the SBPVP)
MiniPiez_KvaluesUW_Site1.csv (K (hydraulic conducitivity) values derived from streambed temperature profiling)
MiniPiezData_Site1.csv (head data from the mini piezometers used to calculated seepage velocity)
SBPVP_SVmday_Site1.csv (seepage velocity determined by the SBPVP)

The data files for Site 2 are:
Jeff_Site2_MiniPiez_Coord.csv (coordinates in Lat/Long for the mini piezometers)
Jeff_Site2_SBPVP_Coord.csv (coordinates in Lat/Long for the SBPVP)
MiniPiez_KvaluesUW_Site2.csv (K (hydraulic conducitivity) values derived from streambed temperature profiling)
MiniPiezData_Site2.csv (head data from the mini piezometers used to calculated seepage velocity)
SBPVP_SVmday_Site2.csv (seepage velocity determined by the SBPVP)
